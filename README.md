## Multi-Agent Pathfinding:
- could be a pdf instead of markdown
- What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?
- What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?
- Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?
- How should we understand an instance of your model and what your custom visualization shows?
